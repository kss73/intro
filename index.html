         <h1>Why UX Design and Usability Testing? Where do you see yourself within this nexus of UX design and product development? </h1>
  <h2>Growing up I have always been fasciniated with art and being able to tell a story just through my paintings. However, I didnt know how I could make this into a career, all I knew is I wanted to be in a client-focused field. I became an information science major and learned through my courses what HCI is. I immediately fell inlove with the concepts of HCI and my goal is to be able to create effective and memorable products for my future clients. I have seen poor designs and how negatively it impacts a company. I want to better understand my client's needs and business goals to create the most efficient products for them.</h2>

         <h1>Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h1>
  <h2>After graduating college, I will be working as a Project manager at Highmark Health. I believe this course and my major courses will allow me to better communicate with my team and also understand my clients. I plan to shift my career to UX designing after I attend graduate school and master in HCI. My long term goal is to go into product development at a startup.</h2>
